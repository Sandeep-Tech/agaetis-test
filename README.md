# blog site UI

Almost entirely written in HTML and CSS with a bit of JS for dropdown.

>The page is hosted on ghpages here: [Blog](https://sandeep-tech.github.io/agaetis-test/ "Blog")

dir structure is simple with index.html in the root and the rest in src folder which is also at the root. Other files are dev dependencies -ignore.
